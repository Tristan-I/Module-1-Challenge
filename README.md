# Module-1-Challenge

## Description
the repository for the module 1 challenge. This challenge is  made for Horiseon Marketing. I refactored this project to test my abilities in improving code. When code is refactored, the code becomes easier to read, and more structurally efficient. I learned about the use of elements, adding alt attributes to photos, and the process of making the front end of a website from start to finish.

## Installation
This is uneccisary for this website.

## Usage
This is a website, you may use the scroll (or up and down arrowkeys) to view more content.
